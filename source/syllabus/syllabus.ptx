      <title>Homework Assignments</title>
      <p>
        There will be regular homework assignments during the semester and will account for 20% of the semester grade. All homework assignments will be completed and submitted via the Lumen OHM. Usually, homework assignments will be available for a few days and are due at midnight. Students can start using OHM right away using the trial period, but to access homework after the trial period, students need to pay for course activation. <alert>To pay for course activation, follow the instructions provided in the link How to access course material-Lumen OHM (which you can find inside Modules)</alert>.

At the end of the course, <alert>two of the lowest homework grades will be dropped</alert>. Late homework will not be accepted, except for very unusual circumstances. Completion of homework assignments in a timely fashion enhances your learning of the topics covered in lectures and prepares you for subsequent topics. However, mere completion of homework assignments does not warrant your success in the course.  You are expected to be persistently involved in the thought process for developing concepts and skills that you are expected to acquire for completing the course successfully. Problems on your tests will be like examples done in class and problems in your homework so working on the homework problems, coming to class, taking notes, and STUDYING YOUR NOTES are all essential if you want to do well in this course and get something out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
      <alert>Notes:</alert>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you have any questions regarding the homework, reach out to me through email. I will not respond if you send me a message on the Lumen OHM.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Plan to spend about 3 hours outside of class on work related to the class for every hour of class time.

      <title>Class Participation</title>
      <p>
        Students are encouraged to attend class regularly and actively participate in group discussions while solving assigned problems. Class participation will account for 5% of your final grade. Two of the lowest class participation grades will be dropped at the end of the semester.
      </p>

      <title>Midterm Exams</title>
      <p>
        There will be a total of three midterm exams <alert>(Exam 1, Exam 2, and Exam 3)</alert>. Each midterm exam accounts for 16% of your final grade. Calculators will be allowed unless otherwise instructed. Exam dates will be announced at least one week in advance, but a tentative exam schedule is given in the Table above. (Apple watch and cell phones are not allowed during exams).
      </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
      <title>Final Exam</title>
      <p>
        The final exam will be comprehensive.  It accounts for 27% of your final grade. If you do not take the final exam, you cannot pass the course.
      </p>
      <p>
<alert>Note:</alert> In general, there are no makeup tests. If you miss a test and you do not have an excellent WRITTEN excuse (from a doctor, for example), you will get a zero on the test. If you have some problems with the scheduling of a test, email me several days BEFORE the test to discuss the matter. In the rare event that a makeup test is given, the makeup test may be more difficult than the original test.

      All work needed to arrive at the final answer must be shown on Exams. Student work must be clear, neat, and accurate, and make use of the appropriate mathematical symbols and syntax in order to receive full credit. Correct answers without justification earn little or no credit. Partial credit is given for incorrect answers only when substantial progress is made toward the right answer and correct logic is demonstrated.

<title>Generative AI</title>
    <p>
      
In this course, you can optimize your learning experience with the help of AI tools like <url href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha </url>,<url href="https://www.symbolab.com/"> Symbolab</url>,<url href="https://www.khanmigo.ai/" > Khanmingo</url>, and <url href="https://thetawise.ai/chat">thetawise</url>. With Wolfram Alpha, access computational knowledge to solve complex mathematical problems and generate step-by-step solutions. Symbolab provides interactive step-by-step solutions, aiding in understanding problem-solving processes. Khanmingo offers personalized practice exercises and video lessons tailored to your needs, while thetawise utilizes adaptive learning algorithms to provide personalized tutoring sessions and practice materials. These tools collectively support your problem-solving skills, and overall success in your math coursework.
However, you should note that the material generated by these tools may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic. For example, an AI tool might incorrectly simplify a complex trigonometric identity, leading to a wrong solution. Additionally, relying too much on AI may inhibit your own independent thinking and creativity, potentially hindering your overall learning and understanding of mathematical concepts, so use it thoughtfully to enhance rather than replace your learning process.

      <title>Academic Integrity</title>
      <p>
At Utah Valley University, faculty and students operate in an atmosphere of mutual trust. Maintaining an atmosphere of academic integrity allows for free exchange of ideas and enables all members of the community to achieve their highest potential. Our goal is to foster an intellectual atmosphere that produces scholars of integrity and imaginative thought. In all academic work, the ideas and contributions of others must be appropriately acknowledged and UVU students are expected to produce their own original academic work. 

      </p>
      <p>
        Faculty and students share the responsibility of ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at UVU. Students have a responsibility to promote academic integrity at the university by not participating in or facilitating others' participation in any act of academic dishonesty. As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their <url href="https://policy.uvu.edu/getDisplayFile/5bedd0ef7b23736d542192e3">rights and responsibilities</url>. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, assessments, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Likewise, instructors are responsible to clearly state expectations and model best practices. 
      </p>
       <p>
        Further information on what constitutes academic dishonesty is detailed in <url href="https://policy.uvu.edu/getDisplayFile/5bedd0ef7b23736d542192e3">UVU Policy 541:Student Code of Conduct </url>.

          <p>
            Definition: Academic integrity is a basic principle which requires that students take credit only for ideas and efforts that are their own. Cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, and other forms of academic dishonesty are often defined as the submission of materials in assignments, exams, or other academic work that is based on sources that are prohibited by the faculty member or in ways that do not properly cite the source of a student's ideas and content.

      <title>Equity and Title IX</title>
      <p>
        Utah Valley University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age (40 and over), disability, veteran status, pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy-related conditions, citizenship, genetic information, or other basis protected by applicable law, including Title IX and 34 C.F.R. Part 106, in employment, treatment, admission, access to educational programs and activities, or other University benefits or services. Inquiries about nondiscrimination at UVU may be directed to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights or UVU’s Title IX Coordinator at 801-863-7999-TitleIX@uvu.edu – 800 W University Pkwy, Orem, 84058, Suite BA 203.

      <title>Religious Accomodation</title>
      <p>
        UVU values and acknowledges the array of worldviews, faiths, and religions represented in our student body, and as such provides supportive accommodations for students. Religious belief or conscience broadly includes religious, non-religious, theistic, or non-theistic moral or ethical beliefs as well as participation in religious holidays, observances, or activities. Accommodations may include scheduling or due-date modifications or make-up assignments for missed class work.
To seek a religious accommodation, a student must provide written notice to the instructor and the Director of Accessibility Services at accessibilityservices@uvu.edu. If the accommodation relates to a scheduling conflict, the notice should include the date, time, and brief description of the difficulty posed by the conflict. Such requests should be made as soon as the student is aware of the prospective scheduling conflict.

While religious expression is welcome throughout campus, UVU also has a specially dedicated space for meditation, prayer, reflection, or other forms of religious expression.
